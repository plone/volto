# @plone/volto-slate

Implementation of the Volto text block using the [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/) JavaScript editor framework.

This is a Volto core add-on since Volto 16.0.0.
It is released within Volto in the same code base.

For projects using either the Volto 16.x.x or 17.x.x series, it is *not* required to be installed as an add-on.

From Volto 18.0.0 onwards (including alphas), it is a released package as a stand-alone add-on in Volto.
It is declared as part of its `dependencies`.

See [`volto-slate`](https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/configuration/volto-slate/) for more information about Volto and how to use it.
