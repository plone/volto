- Upgrade slate to latest libraries
- When normalizing slate text, lift the list nodes (ul/ol) if they are children
  of list items (li) up to the level of the list item
- When normalizing slate text, remove any empty element (has no text) when it's
  a child of a list item
- fix pasting a table that was copied from LibreOffice
- pasting a single node that can be converted to a Volto block (an image or
  table) is now properly converted to a block
