## Introduction

[Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is a ReactJS-based frontend for the [Plone](https://plone.org) Content Management System.
It is the default frontend starting with the Plone 6 release.

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a CMS built on Python with more than 20 years of history and experience.

Plone has features that appeal to developers and users alike, such as an intuitive editing interface, customizable content types, hierarchical organization, and a sophisticated permissions model.
This allows you to build anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade intranets.

Volto exposes all these features and communicates with Plone via its [REST API](https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi).

Volto features the Pastanaga editor, a modern block-based content layout editor.
It is extensible and customizable, so you can adapt the provided default blocks to meet your requirements, or build new ones.

Volto is extensible using add-ons.
You can build your own or choose from the community released ones:

- [Volto Add-ons in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Avolto-addon%2Cvolto)
- [Volto Awesome](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto)
