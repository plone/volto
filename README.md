## Introduction

[Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is a ReactJS-based frontend for the [Plone](https://plone.org) Content Management System. It will become the default UI for the upcoming Plone 6 release.

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a CMS built on Python with more than 20 years of history and experience.

Plone has very interesting features that appeal to developers and users alike,
such as customizable content types, hierarchical URL object traversing and a
sophisticated content workflow powered by a granular permissions model. This
allows you to build anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade
intranets.

Volto exposes all these features and communicates with Plone via its [REST API](https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi).
Volto has the ability of being easily extensible, themeable, and customizable.

It features the Pastanaga editor, a modern block-based content layout editor. It is extensible and customizable, so you can adapt the default blocks provided to match your requirements, or build new ones to cover them.

Volto is extensible using add-ons.
You can build your own or choose from the community released ones:

- [Volto Add-ons in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Avolto-addon%2Cvolto)
- [Volto Awesome](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto)

## Demo

You can try a Volto online demo in [https://6.demo.plone.org/](https://6.demo.plone.org/)

### Try the demo locally

If you want to give Volto a quick try and you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed in your computer, bootstrap the demo using `docker-compose`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/plone/volto.git
cd volto
docker-compose up
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Quick Start

First get all the requirements installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js LTS (16.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python](https://python.org/) - See below for specific versions.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (if using the Plone docker images)

*UPDATE 2022-10-25*: Since 2022-10-25, NodeJS 18 is in LTS state (https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule). However, due to changes in internal SSL libraries, some Volto dependencies have been deprecated and need to be updated in order to continue working in NodeJS 18, mainly Webpack 4 (see: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532#issuecomment-947525539 for further information). You can still use it, but NodeJS should be run under a special flag: `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`. See also Volto's PR: https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/3699 for more information.

The versions of Python that are supported in Volto depend on the version of Plone that you use.

| Plone | Python | Volto |
|---|---|---|
| 5.2 | 2.7, 3.6-3.8 | 15.0 |
| 6.0 (beta) | 3.8-3.10 | 16.0 (alpha) |

At the time of this writing, Volto 16 is still in alpha status, and Plone 6 is in beta status.

### Create a Volto project using the generator

Create a new Volto project by using the `@plone/generator-volto` utility.

It will bootstrap a Volto project in a folder of your choice with all the required
boilerplate to start customizing your Volto site.

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto
```
follow the prompts questions, provide `myvoltoproject` as project name then, when it finishes:

```
cd myvoltoproject
```

### Bootstrap the Plone API backend

You can bootstrap a ready Docker Plone container with all the dependencies and ready for Volto use. We recommend to use the Plone docker builds based in `pip` [plone/plone-backend](https://github.com/plone/plone-backend) image:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --name=plone -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=Plone -e PROFILES="plone.volto:default-homepage" plone/plone-backend:6.0.0b3
```

or as an alternative if you have experience with Plone and you have all the
dependencies installed on your system, you can use the supplied convenience buildout in the
`api` folder by issuing the command:

```shell
make build-backend
```

#### Recommended Plone version

Volto is the default UI for Plone 6, so it will work for all Plone 6 released versions.

For the Plone 5 series, the latest released version of Plone 5 (with Python 3) is recommended (at the time of writing 5.2.9).

#### KGS (known good set of versions) for backend packages

On Plone 6, we recommend using the known good set (KGS) of package versions that are specified in the Plone release.

On Plone 5, Volto is currently tested with the following packages pinned to specific versions, and we recommend using the same versions, which are:

- plone.restapi 8.30.0
- plone.rest 2.0.0a5
- plone.volto 4.0.0a13

This would be the docker command to spawn a Plone 5 container with the right KGS versions:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --name=plone -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=Plone -e ADDONS="plone.restapi==8.30.0 plone.volto==4.0.0a13 plone.rest==2.0.0a5 plone.app.iterate==4.0.2 plone.app.vocabularies==4.3.0" -e PROFILES="plone.volto:default-homepage" plone/plone-backend
```

### Start Volto

```shell
yarn start
```

## Node Support

- Node 16: Supported since Volto 14
- Node 14: Supported since Volto 8.8.0
- Node 12: Deprecated from Volto 16 onwards. It was supported since Volto 4
- Node 10: Deprecated from Volto 13 onwards. It was supported since Volto 1 (and its predecessor "plone-react")

## Browser support

Volto works well with any modern (evergreen) browser, including their mobile
flavors: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.

We do not guarantee that deprecated browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer 11) are supported by Volto. Although proven possible, it's too great an effort to maintain. It is left to the integrator to provide support for it.

## Upgrades

You can find the upgrade guide here: https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/upgrade-guide/index.html

## Volto Development

For Volto development you need all the requirements already mentioned on the
[Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

### Checkout the Volto repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/plone/volto.git
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
yarn
```

### Install Plone backend

Either using a Docker command:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --name=plone -p 8080:8080 -e SITE=Plone -e PROFILES="plone.volto:default-homepage" plone/plone-backend:6.0.0b3
```

or using the convenience makefile command:

```shell
make start-backend-docker
```

or running Plone on your machine (advanced), additional dependencies might be
required, only for Plone experienced integrators/developers. Check the [Plone
Installation Documentation](https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation.html).

```shell
make build-backend
```

### Run frontend

Either using a Docker command:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --name=volto --link backend -p 3000:3000 -e RAZZLE_INTERNAL_API_PATH=http://backend:8080/Plone -e RAZZLE_DEV_PROXY_API_PATH=http://backend:8080/Plone plone/plone-frontend:latest
```

or using the convenience makefile command:

```shell
make start-frontend-docker
```

or from the local repository code:

```shell
yarn && yarn start
```

### Browsing

Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Testing

```shell
yarn test
```

## Acceptance testing

Here you can find a guide on how acceptance testing is done in Volto:

https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/developer-guidelines/acceptance-tests.html

## Translations

If you would like contribute to translate Volto into several languages, please, read the [Internationalization (i18n) guide](https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/recipes/i18n.html).

## Contributors

<a href="https://github.com/plone/volto/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=plone/volto" />
</a>

## Alternative backends

Volto also supports other APIs like [Guillotina](https://guillotina.io/), a
Python resource management system, inspired by Plone and using the same basic
concepts like traversal, content types, and permissions model.

Last but not least, it also supports a [Volto Node.js-based backend reference](https://github.com/plone/volto-reference-backend) API implementation that
demos how other systems could also use Volto to display and create content
through it.

### Run a Guillotina backend

*Disclaimer:* Guillotina doesn't support the full API/features that Plone provides. Contributors are welcome.

```shell
docker-compose -f g-api/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

or using the convenience makefile command:

```shell
make start-backend-docker-guillotina
```

### Running the acceptance tests with Guillotina backend

If you want to use Guillotina as a backend to run the tests you should run:

```shell
yarn ci:start-api-plone-guillotina
```
