## Introduction

[Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is a ReactJS-based frontend for the [Plone](https://plone.org) Content Management System. It is the default frontend starting with the Plone 6 release.

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a CMS built on Python with more than 20 years of history and experience.

Plone has features that appeal to developers and users alike, such as an intuitive editing interface, customizable content types, hierarchical organization, and a sophisticated permissions model.
This allows you to build anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade intranets.

Volto exposes all these features and communicates with Plone via its [REST API](https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi).

Volto features the Pastanaga editor, a modern block-based content layout editor.
It is extensible and customizable, so you can adapt the default blocks provided to match your requirements, or build new ones to cover them.

Volto is extensible using add-ons.
You can build your own or choose from the community released ones:

- [Volto Add-ons in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Avolto-addon%2Cvolto)
- [Volto Awesome](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto)

## Supported Plone and Python versions

Volto is the default UI for Plone 6.
It will work for all released Plone 6 versions.

For the Plone 5 series, the [latest released version of Plone 5](https://plone.org/download/releases) is recommended.

The versions of Python that are supported in Volto depend on the version of Plone that you use.

Volto works well with the current version of any modern browser, including their mobile flavors: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

We do not guarantee that outdated browsers such as Internet Explorer 11 are supported by Volto.

## Known good set of versions for backend packages

On Plone 6, we recommend using the known good set (KGS) of package versions that are specified in the Plone release.

On Plone 5, Volto is currently tested with the following packages pinned to specific versions, and we recommend using the same versions, which are:
