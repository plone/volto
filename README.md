## Introduction

[Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is a ReactJS-based frontend for the [Plone](https://plone.org) Content Management System.
It is the default frontend starting with the Plone 6 release.

[Plone](https://plone.org) is a CMS built on Python with more than 20 years of history and experience.

Plone has features that appeal to developers and users alike, such as an intuitive editing interface, customizable content types, hierarchical organization, and a sophisticated permissions model.
This allows you to build anything from simple websites to enterprise-grade intranets.

Volto exposes all these features and communicates with Plone via its [REST API](https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi).

Volto features the Pastanaga editor, a modern block-based content layout editor.
It is extensible and customizable, so you can adapt the provided default blocks to meet your requirements, or build new ones.

Volto is extensible using add-ons.
You can build your own or choose from the community released ones:

- [Volto Add-ons in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Avolto-addon%2Cvolto)
- [Volto Awesome](https://github.com/collective/awesome-volto)

## Monorepo structure

This repository has had the shape of a monorepo, where "mono" means "single" and "repo" is short for "repository".
This means that several apps and libraries related to each other are stored in the same repository.
They are managed together but released individually.
This allows the code to be shared effectively, and unifies tracking of changes across all of the apps and libraries.
