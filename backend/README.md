# Convenience backend build

You can use this `backend` folder to bootstrap a local Plone backend.
You need a supported Python version to run it.

To start development, issue the following commands in a terminal session.

```shell
make
make create-site
make start
```

The Plone backend will start in `http://localhost:8080/Plone`.

To see all `make` commands and their descriptions, you can use the following command.

```shell
make help
```
