# Volto add-ons conceptual guides

Volto has a built-in extensible and pluggable system to enhance the Plone CMS user interface.
This system is implemented through the [`@plone/registry`](https://plone-registry.readthedocs.io/) package.
It helps developers extend Volto in a pluggable way through {term}`add-on`s.

%TODO: This matches with https://plone-registry.readthedocs.io/conceptual-guides/add-on-registry.html#what-is-an-add-on. Copy here when that one is ready.
