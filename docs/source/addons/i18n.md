# Add-on Internationalization

The internationalization workflow is the same as in main Volto: you develop your add-on, then add the translations to your code.
See {ref}`creating-i18n-strings` for how to mark strings and phrases as translatable.

Your add-on has a `locales` folder with a `.pot` file.

1. Create the following structure in your add-ons `locales` folder for every language you want to support.
    As an example for the language Italian:

    ```text
    it
    └── LC_MESSAGES
        └── volto.po
    ```

2. Make sure you depend your add-on on `@plone/scripts` library.

    ```json
    "dependencies": {
        "@plone/scripts": "*",
    }
    ```

    This will allow you to run `yarn i18n` from inside your add-on, even if it's outside a project.

3. Run `yarn i18n` in the context of your add-on.
4. Go to each `.po` file in your `locales` folder, and write the translations for each translation literal.

In the context of your project (eg. in the root), run `yarn i18n` to merge the add-on translations with the ones of your project.

## Override translations

The workflow allows you to override translations from your project scope, so the project translations "always win".
