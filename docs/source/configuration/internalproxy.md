# Internal proxy to content backend API

The server side Volto {term}`SSR` process (based on Razzle) has an internal proxy to the backend API
enabled by default.

It provides a better developer experience out of the box, so the developer doesn't has to
deal with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and can focus on
develop/test drive/demo Volto.

To understand the need for the internal proxy, there are three processes running in a Volto website:

1. A frontend web application running in your browser (JavaScript)
2. A Node.js server process that delivers the JavaScript to the client and does
   {term}`server-side rendering` (SSR) of your pages on first request (JavaScript, the
   Razzle package is used for SSR)
3. A Plone server process that stores and delivers all content through a REST API (Python)

## Configuration

The default values from Volto configuration expect a Plone content backend located at `http://localhost:8080/Plone`.

What happens in the default development configuration/setup:

* The client side Volto JavaScript files precooked HTML (SSR) is served from http://localhost:3000/ by the Node.js server process
* The client JavaScript does API requests for content and other data on the same url at http://localhost:3000/++api++/
* The Node.js service its internal proxy requests the data from the Plone content backend API and delivers
back json to the frontend.
* The web browser application is happy, because all connections go through the same URL and no CORS related security issues will be triggered.

```{tip}
You could also use the internal proxy for production setups. For convenience and for
testing/demoing using the stock build, it is also enabled in production mode since
Volto 14. But it is bad for performance because the server side running Node.js process
is also responsable for generating the SSR HTML. With nginx, Apache or another
'reverse proxy' you can also create an internal API mount which is more suited for
that. For more deployment information see {doc}`../deploying/seamless-mode`.
```

### Examples redefining the proxy target

You can redefine the local proxy target by using the `RAZZLE_DEV_PROXY_API_PATH` or setting `devProxyToApiPath` in the configuration object (`src/config.js`).

For example, if the path to your Plone site is `http://localhost:8081/mysite`, add the following to the bottom of the `src/config.js` file:

```js
export const settings = {
  ...defaultSettings,
  devProxyToApiPath: 'http://localhost:8081/mysite',
};
```

or use the environment variable:

```bash
RAZZLE_DEV_PROXY_API_PATH=http://localhost:8081/mysite yarn start
```

This redefines the request path from the internal proxy of the server side Node.js process to the Plone content backend API, but leaves the frontend Volto process making all content requests to `http://localhost:3000/++api++/`.

### Advanced usage

See {doc}`../recipes/environment-variables` for recipes for internal proxy usage.
