# About Semantic UI

Volto uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and
[React Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com)
(via [semantic-ui-less](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-LESS))
as development framework. It helps you to create websites with responsive
layouts using human-friendly HTML. Semantic UI treats words and classes as
exchangeable concepts. Classes use syntax from natural languages like
noun/modifier relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts
intuitively.

One of its main features is theming. Components in Semantic UI are designed to
help developers adhere to
[progressive truthfulness](https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html)
in their development. Instead of having to create components from a blank
canvas, developers using Semantic UI only need to specify how their components
should differ from the default theme using CSS variables and other CSS
overrides (if required).

It features a sophisticated theming engine built with [LESS](https://lesscss.org/)
CSS preprocessor that allows you to have different layers of defaults/CSS
variables modifiers/CSS overrides in place, inheriting one from the parent in
a sensible manner:
