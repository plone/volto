```{deprecated} Volto 18
Semantic UI development and maintenance has been inconsistent since 2018.
The Volto Team made the decision to move forward in a sustainable direction.
Plone 7 will use a different theming approach, based on the [`@plone/components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plone/components)—which in turn is based on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html)—and [`@plone/theming`](https://github.com/plone/volto/tree/main/packages/theming) packages.
Using Semantic UI theming for your project or add-on is deprecated from Volto 18 onward, and will be removed in Plone 7.
