# Icons

Volto has a pre-defined set of SVG icons from the Pastanaga UI icon system.
They are available under [Volto icons](https://github.com/plone/volto/tree/main/src/icons).

The following example shows how to display one of these icons.

```js
import addUserSVG from '@plone/volto/icons/add-user.svg';
import { Icon } from '@plone/volto/components';

<Icon name={addUserSVG} size="24px" />;
```

```{note}
These icons are intended to be used only in the "official" Pastanaga UI.
Please refrain from using them on personal projects unless they are based on the Pastanaga UI.
```
