# Internationalization


{term}`Internationalization` (i18n) is the process of creating user interfaces which are suitable for different languages and cultural contexts.
This chapter describes the most common use cases for internationalization when developing your {doc}`../addons/index` or contributing to the Volto core itself.


## Process and file structure overview

Volto uses the library [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl) to provide translations for any potential language.
Anything in the [official documentation of react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/) also applies to Volto.

The workflow for creating *new* translatable text strings is as follows:

1.  Create translatable i18n strings in your code.
1.  Extract all i18n strings from your code with a script and create artifacts, like `.po` and `.pot` files.
1.  Use your favorite editor to translate all i18n strings by editing the `.po` files.
1.  Re-run the script, which then moves the translations from the `.po` files into `.json` files for Volto to use.
1.  Edit [`packages/volto/src/constants/Languages.cjs`](https://github.com/plone/volto/blob/main/packages/volto/src/constants/Languages.cjs), adding your new language's locale code, as defined in {ref}`i18n-l10n-locale-and-language-tag-conventions-label`.
1.  Run the unit tests as described in {ref}`run-jest-tests-on-volto-core-label`, following the prompt to update the snapshot when the test fails.

This way of organizing translations relies on [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext), a proven and established system with great tool support.
`.json` files in react-intl are equivalent to `.mo` files in gettext.

All translation files are located under the directory [`packages/volto/locales`](https://github.com/plone/volto/tree/main/packages/volto/locales).

The file {file}`packages/volto/locales/volto.pot` holds all extracted i18n strings, and acts as the source template for all the `.po` files.
A translation for each language is stored in two files, both with their language code in the file name or path.
Using English as an example, the `.po` file is stored at {file}`packages/volto/locales/en/LC_MESSAGES/volto.po`, and the `.json` file is stored at {file}`packages/volto/locales/en.json`.
The abridged file structure for English would appear as follows.

```text
locales/
├── en
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── en.json
└── volto.pot
```

## Create i18n strings

In this section, you can learn how to translate HTML elements and attributes.


### Translate text in HTML elements

`react-intl` can identify translatable texts with the `FormattedMessage` components.
As the name of this component suggests, it's also possible to format your messages as your prefer.

The following code snippet is an example of how you can write a text with the content `Hello World`, which can be identified via `hello_world`.

```jsx
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';

function HelloWorld(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <FormattedMessage
        id="hello_world"
        defaultMessage="Hello World"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The identifier `hello_world` is then commonly used across all the translations.
There are more features available, such as using placeholders.
See the documentation for all features in the [`FormattedMessage` component](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/components#formattedmessage).


### Translate attributes

As `FormatMessage` is only suitable for creating text within HTML elements, it cannot be used for translating individual attributes.
But with the method [`formatMessage`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#formatmessage), there is another way to translate primitive strings.

This approach can be best explained with an example.
Assume you have a component called `TeaserImage` which contains an image that has, for accessibility reasons, the `alt` attribute.
To translate the `alt` attribute, you have to do the following steps:

1.  Import the following required methods.

    ```js
    import { defineMessages, injectIntl, intlShape } from 'react-intl';
    ```

2.  Define a message (or more) via [`defineMessages`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#definemessagesdefinemessage):

    ```js
    const messages = defineMessages({
      teaserAltText: {
        id: 'teaser_alt_text',
        defaultMessage: 'Teaser Alt Text',
      },
    });
    ```

3.  Because your component class or function needs the method `formatMessage`, there is a special property `intl` that you need to inject in one of the two following ways.

    ```js
    // When using a pure function:
    export default injectIntl(TeaserImage);
    ```

    ```js
    // When using a component:
    @injectIntl
    class TeaserImage extends Component {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    Because you now have another prop available, you need to define it in the `propTypes`:

      ```jsx
      TeaserImage.propTypes = {
        intl: intlShape.isRequired,
        // ...
      };
      ```

4.  As the final last step, you can use the method as follows:

    ```jsx
    <img src="..." alt={intl.formatMessage(messages.teaserAltText)}>
    ```


## Extract i18n strings

Volto provides an i18n extraction script to get all translatable strings from your application.
You can invoke this script with the following command.

```sh
yarn i18n
```

This will generate the following output:

```console
Extracting messages from source files...
Synchronizing messages to pot file...
Synchronizing messages to po files...
Generating the json files...
done!
```

As the output suggests, it will first extract all messages from the source files into `.json` files.
Then it will synchronize the extracted messages with the `.pot` main template and with all the `.po` files found in the project.
This script will combine the messages located in Volto itself and the current project, and combine them into the `.json` files.

(override-i18n-messages)=

## Override i18n messages

If you want to override an existing translation, you should declare the original message again somewhere else in your project.
For example in `src/messages.js`:

```js
import { defineMessages } from 'react-intl';

defineMessages({
  back: {
    id: 'Back',
    defaultMessage: 'Back',
  },
});
```

Then run `yarn i18n`.
You will find the translation ready to override in your `locales` directory, such as `locales/de/LC_MESSAGES/volto.po`.

```text
#: src/config
msgid "Back"
msgstr "My overridden translation"
```

After you set the override, then run `yarn i18n` again to create the `de.json` translation files.
Restart Volto to see the changes applied.

### Translations in shadowed components

The `customizations` folder is excluded from the i18n build, this means that shadowed components do _not_ override translations.
If this was not the case, all the translations in the customized components would be collected again, forcing you to translate them all again in the local project.
You can add or override translated messages in your customizations by following the steps described in {ref}`override-i18n-messages`.

## Contribute translations for an unsupported language

The Volto project welcomes all speakers from the world to include any language, which is not supported yet.

If your language's `.po` file is not available in Volto, [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/plone/volto/issues).
Either you can create the `.po` file or we can do it for you.
After that, you can start contributing your translations.
