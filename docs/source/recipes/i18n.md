# Internationalization

Internationalization (i18n) is the process of creating user interfaces which are suitable for different languages and cultural contexts.
Volto uses the library [react-intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intl) to provide translations for any potential language.
Anything you can read in the [official documentation of react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/README.md) also applies for Volto.

However this section teaches you about the most common use cases relating to i18n you probably will have when developing your [own Add-on](/addons/) or contributing to the Volto core itself.

## Broad overview

The workflow for creating *new* translatable texts is as follows:

1. Create translatable i18n strings in your code
2. Extract all i18n strings from your code with a script and create artifacts like `.po` and `.pot` files
3. Use your favorite editor to translate all i18n strings (i.e. edit the `.po` files)
4. Re-run the script, which then moves the translations from the `.po` files into for Volto usable `.json` files

This way of organizing translations relies on [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext), a proven and established system with great tool support.

All translation files are located under the directory `locales`.
This might look like this:

```shell
$ tree locales/
locales/
├── de
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── de.json
├── en
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── en.json
├── es
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── es.json
├── it
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── it.json
├── ja
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── ja.json
├── nl
│   └── LC_MESSAGES
│       └── volto.po
├── nl.json
└── volto.pot

12 directories, 13 files
```

The file `volto.pot` holds all extracted i18n strings and acts as master template for all the `*.po` files.
The translation for each language is stored within a dedicated sub-directory (like `en` for English, `it` for Italian, etc.) and are stored as `*.po` file and separately stored directly under `locales` as `*.json` file.


## Creating i18n Strings

### Translating Text Within HTML Elements

`react-intl` can identify translatable texts with the `FormattedMessage` components.
As the name of this component suggests, it is also possible to format your messages as your liking.

This is an example of how you can write a text with contents `Hello World`, which can be identified via `hello_world`:

```
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';

function HelloWorld(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <FormattedMessage
        id="hello_world"
        defaultMessage="Hello World"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The identifier `hello_world` is then commonly used between all the translations.
There are also more features available such as using placeholders. See the docs for all features in the [FormattedMessage component](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/Components.md#formattedmessage).

### Translating Attributes

As `FormatMessage` is only suitable for creating text within HTML elements, it cannot be used for translating individual attributes.
But with the method [formatMessage](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/API.md#formatmessage) there exists another way to translate primitive strings.

This approach can be best explained with an example: Assume you have a component called `TeaserImage` which contains an image that has for accessibility reasons the `alt` attribute.

To translate the `alt` attribute, you have to do the following steps:

1. Import the following necessary methods:
```
import { defineMessages, injectIntl, intlShape } from 'react-intl';
```
2. Define a message (or more) via [defineMessages](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/API.md#definemessages):
```
const messages = defineMessages({
  teaserAltText: {
    id: 'teaser_alt_text',
    defaultMessage: 'Teaser Alt Text',
  },
});
```
3. As the method `formatMessage` in our component class/function is needed, there is a special propery `intl`, that needs to be injected with *either* the following ways:
```
// When using a pure function:
export default injectIntl(TeaserImage);

// OR when using a component:
@injectIntl
class TeaserImage extends Component {
  ...
}
```
Since you now have another prop available, it has to be to properly defined in the propTypes:
```
TeaserImage.propTypes = {
  intl: intlShape.isRequired,
  ...
};
```
4. As last step, the method can be used like this:
```
<img src="..." alt={intl.formatMessage(messages.teaserAltText)}>
```

## Extracting i18n Strings

Volto provides an i18n extraction script to get all translatable strings from your application.

This script can be invoked by this command:

```sh
$ yarn i18n
```

This will generate the following output:

```
Extracting messages from source files...
Synchronizing messages to pot file...
Synchronizing messages to po files...
Generating the json files...
done!
```

As the output suggests it will first extract all messages from the source files into `.json` files.
Then it will synchronize the extracted messages with the `.pot` master template and with all the `.po` files found in the project.
This script will combine the messages located in Volto itself and the current project, and combine them into the `.json` files.

## Contributing translations for a unsupported language

The Volto project welcomes all speakers from the world to include any language, which is not supported yet.

You can contribute to translate Volto into severals languages at [Transifex.net](https://www.transifex.com/plone/plone5/volto-pot/).

When you done your translation resource at Transifex.net, you need to add the locales files into Volto project, for that you need use [transifex-client](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction) tool and [install it](https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client).

### Update language from Transifex

To get translate the latest translation changes, you have to do the following steps:

1. You can pull the latest changes for a specific language, for example **'de'** from **Transifex.net** for *Volto project*, by this command:
```sh
$ tx pull -f -l de
```
This will generate the following output:
```sh
tx INFO: Pulling translations for resource plone5.volto-pot (source: locales/volto.pot)
tx INFO:  -> de: locales/de/LC_MESSAGES/volto.po
tx INFO: Done.
```
Also can pull the latest changes for all languages available at from **Transifex.net** for *Volto project*, by this command:
```sh
$ tx pull -f --all
```
2. You need updated the json file for the language updated from **Transifex.net** for *Volto project*, by this command:
```sh
$ yarn i18n
```
This command generate again the ``locales/de.json`` file updated, it is needed for Volto app.
3. Please, update the ``CHANGELOG.md`` file, make commits and push the changes via pull request at the repository.

**Tip:** For more information about each command, use ``tx <command> --help``. As an example, to learn more about the ``tx pull`` command, run ``tx pull --help``.

### Add new language from Transifex

1. You should check what languages are available in **Transifex.net** to translate for the [Volto project](https://www.transifex.com/plone/plone5/volto-pot/). If the language to be translated does not exist, please [request it](https://docs.transifex.com/projects/adding-and-removing-project-languages).
2. You can pull the new language for example *Portuguese (Brazil)* aka **'pt_BR'** from **Transifex.net** for *Volto project*, by this command:
```sh
$ tx pull -f -l pt_BR
```
3. You new to modify the ``src/server.jsx`` file and add in the *'import section'* as the follow:
```
import ptBrLocale from '~/../locales/pt_BR.json';
```
Also you need define the new locale into *'locales const'* as the follow:
```
  pt: ptBrLocale,
```
4. You new to modify the ``src/constants/Languages.js`` file and add a new line at *'module.exports'* section as the follow:
```
  pt_BR: 'Português (Brasil)',
```
5. You need create the json file for the language created from **Transifex.net** for *Volto project*, by this command:
```sh
$ yarn i18n
```
This command generate the ``locales/pt_BR.json`` file, it is needed for Volto app.
6. Please, update the ``CHANGELOG.md`` file, make commits and push the changes via pull request at the repository.
