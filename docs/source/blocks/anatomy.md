# Blocks anatomy

Every blocks is composed of an edit (`Edit.jsx`) and a view (`View.jsx`) component.

This components can be as simple as a dummy component, no boilerplate is required.
This is an example of the `Edit.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Edit = props => {
  return <div>I'm the Block edit component!</div>;
};

export default Edit;
```

and the `View.jsx`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const View = props => {
  return <div>I'm the Block view component!</div>;
};

export default View;
```

## Block view component props

The view component of a block receives these props from the Blocks Engine:

- `id` - the unique ID for the current block
- `properties` - the current content
- `data` - the data of the block (stored in the block itself)
- `blocksConfig` - a (potentially customized) copy of the
  `config.blocks.blocksConfig` configuration object, useful for blocks that
  need to render other blocks

You can use them to render the view component.

## Block edit component props

The edit component of a block receives these props from the Blocks Engine:

- `type` - the type of the block
- `id` - the unique ID for the current block
- `data` - the data of the block (stored in the block itself)
- `selected` - (Bool) true if the block is currently selected
- `index` - the block index order in the list of blocks
- `pathname` - the current URL pathname
- `onAddBlock` - handler for adding a block in the block list
- `onMutateBlock` - handler for mutating a block type into another
- `onChangeBlock` - handler for changing the data of that block
- `onSelectBlock` - handler for selecting the block
- `onDeleteBlock` - handler for deleting the block
- `onFocusPreviousBlock` - handler for focusing the previous block in the block list
- `onFocusNextBlock` - handler for focusing the next block in the block list
- `handleKeyDown` - handler for managing press keys while the block is selected
- `onMoveBlock` - handler for moving blocks
- `blocksConfig` - a (potentially customized) copy of the
  `config.blocks.blocksConfig` configuration object, useful for blocks that
  need to render other blocks

You can use all these props to render your edit block and model its behavior.
