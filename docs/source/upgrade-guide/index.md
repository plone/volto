# Upgrade Guide

This upgrade guide lists all breaking changes in Volto and explains the
 steps that are necessary to upgrade to the lastest version.

!!! note
    There are times that updating the Volto boilerplate (the one generated by
    `@plone/generator-volto`) is enough to fulfill all the changes. If you haven't
    heavilly modified it, moving things around and copying over your dependencies might
    do when dealing with upgrades. We keep the generator up to date and in sync with
    current Volto release. Please notice that the generator is able to tell you when it
    runs that it's outdated. The generator is also able to "update" your project with
    the latest changes and propose you if you want to merge them, run it on the top of
    your project and answer the prompt.

## Upgrading to Volto 12.x.x

### Volto Configuration Registry

The configuration object in Volto is located in the `~/config` module and uses it as
container of Volto's config taking advantage of the ES6 module system. So we "import"
the config every time we need it, then the exported config data in that module
"magically" is there whenever we want to access to it.

It's been a while since we are experiencing undesired side-effects from "circular import
dependency" problems in Volto, due to the very nature of the solution (importing the
`~/config`). Although they aren't much noticeable, they are there, waiting for bitting
us. In fact, circular dependencies are common in NodeJS world, and the very nature of
how it works make them "workable" thanks to the NodeJS own import resolution algorithm.
So the "build" always works, although we have them, but that leads to weird problems
like (just to mention one of them) the HMR (Hot Module Reloader) does not work properly.

That's why in this version we are introducing the new Volto's Configuration Registry.
It's a centralised singleton that it is populated from the core config module and can be
modified by the addons and the project itself. The code, instead of using imports to get
it, imports the singleton and then access the proper registry key inside it (`settings`,
`blocks`, `views`, etc...)

### Changes in your code (and local customizations)

This was the old way:
```js
import { settings } from '~/config'
...

console.log(settings.apiPath)
...
```

and this is the new way:

```js
import config from '@plone/volto/registry'
...

console.log(config.settings.apiPath)
config.settings.isMultilingual = true
...
```

!!! warning Deprecation notice
    The old way using the import to get Volto's configuration will still be working as
    long as you support it in your project `src/config` but it will be deprecated and
    will stop working from *Volto 14* on.

It is *highly* recommendable that you use the new configuration registry right away. Your
custom code (and Volto customizations using the shadowing engine) has to adapt to the
new way of reading the config from the new Volto's Configuration. However, it won't be
mandatory until Volto 14, leaving the community time to adapt their code and projects.

!!! tip Recommended for addons
    If you are an addon maintainer and you migrate your add-on to be Volto 12 compatible,
    it's recommended that you add it as `peerDependencies` for Volto 12.

    ```json
      "peerDependencies": {
        "@plone/volto": ">= 12.0.0"
      }
    ```

#### Changes in in your project's `config` module

-};
-
-export const addonRoutes = [...defaultAddonRoutes];
-export const addonReducers = { ...defaultAddonReducers };
```

notice from the diff, that you must add this import at the top of the file:

```js
import '@plone/volto/config';
```

Then add this function as default export at the end of your `src/config.js` module:

```js
export default function applyConfig(config) {
  // Add here your project config
  return config;
}
```

It has the same signature and it's used like the `applyConfig()` function in `index.js`
module add-ons. You should place your project's configuration here and mutate the config
like you would do it in addons.

Let's show it in an example. Let's say you have this config in your project's `src/config` module:

```js
export const settings = {
  ...defaultSettings,
  isMultilingual: true,
  supportedLanguages: ['en', 'de'],
  defaultLanguage: 'de',
  navDepth: 3,
};
```

then you'll add the `applyConfig()` function as default export and copy that settings key in it:

```js
export default function applyConfig(config) {
  config.settings = {
    ...config.settings,
    isMultilingual: true,
    supportedLanguages: ['en', 'de'],
    defaultLanguage: 'de',
    navDepth: 3,
  };
  return config;
}
```

!!! warning
    The add-ons you might be using might need to migrate to use the new
    configuration registry too. Make sure all of them are already migrated to Volto 12.

!!! tip
    Although might be daunting, the migration is quite straight forward, and the refactoring
    of the required code is undergo through a series of "search and replace" in your IDE of choice.

#### Changes in your project's `package.json`

You need to update the `setupFiles` key of your `jest` configuration:

```diff
     "setupFiles": [
-      "@plone/volto/test-setup.js"
+      "@plone/volto/test-setup-globals.js",
+      "@plone/volto/test-setup-config.js"
     ],
```

#### Changes in snapshots tests in your project

Please note that your tests' snapshots will also change because of the new testing mocks
(in widgets, blocks and in views). You should review them, make sure that the mocks are
there instead of the real mocked components and accept them.

### Alternative - both configurations coexisting

!!! warning
    This configuration is *not recommended* and might lead to inconsistencies and has been tested
    only partially and can you can find unseen problems. This method is only a workaround in case the
    addons you are using are not yet migrated or you can't to migrate your code. And in
    any case, as stated above, it will be deprecated and will stop working in Volto 14.

Make the following changes to your `src/config.js`, first remove the main imports, and add
the import to the new config registry:

```diff
-import {
-  settings as defaultSettings,
-  views as defaultViews,
-  widgets as defaultWidgets,
-  blocks as defaultBlocks,
-  addonReducers as defaultAddonReducers,
-  addonRoutes as defaultAddonRoutes,
-} from '@plone/volto/config';
+import ConfigRegistry from '@plone/volto/registry';
```

then *after the last existing import* in your existing `src/config.js` add:

```js
import * as voltoDefaultConfig from '@plone/volto/config';
```

Remove all the default exports, but save your config for later use:

```diff
-export const settings = {
-  ...defaultSettings,
-};
-
-export const views = {
-  ...defaultViews,
-};
-
-export const widgets = {
-  ...defaultWidgets,
-};
-
-export const blocks = {
-  ...defaultBlocks,
-};
-
-export const addonRoutes = [...defaultAddonRoutes];
-export const addonReducers = { ...defaultAddonReducers };
```

showing in the diff the default ones, you should have your configuration inside those, like:

```js
export const settings = {
  ...defaultSettings,
  isMultilingual: true,
  supportedLanguages: ['en', 'de'],
  defaultLanguage: 'de',
  navDepth: 3,
};
```

At the end of your `src/config.js`:

```diff
+const localconfig = {
+  ...voltoDefaultConfig,
+};
+
+const applyLocalConfig = applyConfig(localconfig);
+
+ConfigRegistry.settings = applyLocalConfig.settings;
+ConfigRegistry.blocks = applyLocalConfig.blocks;
+ConfigRegistry.views = applyLocalConfig.views;
+ConfigRegistry.widgets = applyLocalConfig.widgets;
+ConfigRegistry.addonRoutes = applyLocalConfig.addonRoutes;
+ConfigRegistry.addonReducers = applyLocalConfig.addonReducers;
+
+export const settings = applyLocalConfig.settings;
+export const blocks = applyLocalConfig.blocks;
+export const views = applyLocalConfig.views;
+export const widgets = applyLocalConfig.widgets;
+export const addonRoutes = applyLocalConfig.addonRoutes;
+export const addonReducers = applyLocalConfig.addonReducers;
```

Migrate your config to the new config registry style, **but not** as a default export, at
the end of `src/config.js`:

```diff
+function applyConfig(config) {
+  config.settings = {
+    ...config.settings,
+    isMultilingual: true,
+    supportedLanguages: ['en', 'de'],
+    defaultLanguage: 'de',
+    navDepth: 3,
+  };
```

!!! note Recommended
    Although you can keep both ways of using Volto's config it is
    recommended you use the new registry based configuration as soon as possible and we
    discourage you to continue using the old way.


## Upgrading to Volto 11.x.x

### AlignBlock component new placement and import path

Due to problems with circular dependencies, the `AlignBlock` was moved to helpers and used from there.
Unfortunately, it was proven to be worse overall. We move it (with a know workaround) to its rightful place again.

If your code is importing it from helpers, you should update it to the new path:

```diff
- import { AlignBlock } from '@plone/volto/helpers';
+ import AlignBlock from '@plone/volto/components/manage/Sidebar/AlignBlock';
```

### id is removed from FormFieldWrapper

We have removed the id from the FormFieldWrapper because it is coincide with the label id if we don't provide the fieldset.

If you have cypress test which depends on this id then just remove the id from the test and if test fails then just add `.react-select-container` instead of your id. See https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/2102 for more details.

### New Default Listing Template

!!! note
    If you have customized the default listing template this change possibly does not have an effect on  your project.

The default Template for the Listing Block now does no longer contain an image. The old default Template has been renamed to "Summary". This will lead to every Listing Block in your Project that uses the default Template now using the new default Template, and thus, not showing the image.

To resolve this you can change the template of the affected Listing Blocks either manually or by writing a backend script for that.

## Upgrading to Volto 10.x.x

### Remove the Razzle plugins patch

!!! warning
    If you haven't upgraded your project to Volto 9.x.x and followed the upgrade guide
    instructions, you are set and you do not need to do anything.

In order to have support for Razzle plugins as local modules we introduced a patch in
9.0.0 that addressed the lack of support in Razzle 3.3.7 . Unfortunately, not only that
introduced more headaches than benefits, but inadvertently we introduced a bug on the
patch. We've found a workaround to still support plugins as local modules without
patching Razzle, however that forces you to delete the patch introduced in your projects
if you followed the 9.x.x upgrade guide steps.

### getContent changes

The content is no longer fetched from Volto with the `fullobjects` flag in the
request. If your code relied on children being fully serialized with their
parent, you should refactor it. Alternatively, you can set
`settings.bbb_getContentFetchesFullobjects` to `true` to get the old behavior.

### `@testing-library/react` upgrade notice

`@testing-library/react` has been upgraded too, and it comes with some internal API
changes too, so if you make heavy use of it in your tests, you could need to update your
testing code to adapt them. Please refer to the `@testing-library/react` documentation
for further information if needed.

## Upgrading to Volto 9.x.x

### Internal upgrade to use Razzle 3.3.7

!!!note
    If you haven't customized your `razzle.config.js` in your project, or have any
    custom plugin in place, you don't have to do anything.

Razzle is the isometric build system for both the server and the client parts on the top
of which Volto is built. Recently, it has been under heavy development and some new
exciting features have been added to it. The Razzle configuration is now more flexible
and extensible than ever.

This change *might* be breaking for you if you customized the `razzle.config.js` heavily
in your projects. Since the new version adds a new way to extend Razzle configuration,
you should adapt your extensions to the new way of doing it. See the documentation for
more information: https://razzlejs.org/docs/customization#extending-webpack

It also unifies the way the things are extended in Razzle plugins as well, so if you are
using any official or third party Razzle plugins you should upgrade them to the last
version. If you have developed your own Razzle plugin, you should adapt its signature as
well. See the documentation for more information:
https://razzlejs.org/docs/customization#plugins

Razzle 3.3 also has some new *experimental* features, that will be default in the
upcoming Razzle 4, such as the new *React Fast Refresh* feature, which fixes the
annoying breaking of the router after any live refresh.

See the documentation of Razzle for more information: https://razzlejs.org/

#### Changes involved

We need to patch an internal Razzle utility in order to allow the use of non-released
Razzle plugins. This feature will be in Razzle 4, unfortunatelly at this point the
development the Razzle 3 branch is freezed already so we need to amend the original
using the patch. The patch will be obsolete and no longer required once we move to
Razzle 4 (see https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/pull/1467).

!!! note
    Since Volto 9.2.0 the next step IS NOT required anymore.

~~Copy (and overwrite) the `patches` folder into your local project
https://github.com/plone/volto/tree/master/patches or, if you want to be more accurate,
just copy `patches/razzle-plugins.patch` file and overwrite `patches/patchit.sh` file.~~

### Babel config housekeeping

Historically, Volto was using "stage-0" TC-39 proposals. The configuration was starting
showing its age, since Babel 7 dedided to stop maintaining the presets for stages, we
moved to use an static configuration instead of a managed one. That lead to a "living on
the edge" situation since we supported proposals that they didn't make the cut. For more
information about the TC39 approval process read (https://tc39.es/process-document/)

We decided to put a bit of order to caos and declare that Volto will support only
stage-4 approved proposals. They are supported by `@babel/preset-env` out of the box and
provide a good sensible default baseline for Volto.

Proposal deprecations:

- @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators
- @babel/plugin-proposal-function-bind
- @babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions
- @babel/plugin-proposal-logical-assignment-operators
- @babel/plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator
- @babel/plugin-proposal-function-sent

In fact, Volto core only used the first one (decorators) and we did the move to not use
them long time ago. However, if you were using some of the others, your code will stop
compiling. Migrate your code or if you want to use the proposal anyways, you'll need to
provide the configuration to your own project (babel.config.js) in your project root
folder.

You might still be using old-style connecting your components to the Redux store using
`@connect` decorator, in that case, take a look at any connected component in Volto to
take a glimpse on how to migrate the code.

If you were not using any of the deprecated proposals (the most common use case), then
you are good to go and you don't have to do anything.

### Hoisting problems on some setups

Some people were experimenting weird hoisting issues when installing dependencies. This
was caused by Babel deprecated proposals packages and its peer dependencies that
sometimes conflicted with other installed packages.

Volto's new Babel configuration uses the configuration provided by `babel-razzle-preset`
package (Razzle dependency) and delegates the dependencies management to it, except a
few Babel plugins that Volto still needs to work.

In order for your projects not have any problem with the new configuration and comply
with the new model, you need to remove any local dependency for `@babel/core` and let
Volto handle them.

```diff

     "mrs-developer": "1.2.0",
```

### Recomended `browserslist` in `package.json`

Not a breaking change, but you might want to narrow the targets your Votlo project is
targeting to. This might improve your build times, as well as your bundle size. This is
the recomended `browserlist` you should include in your local `package.json`.

```json
  "browserslist": [
    ">1%",
    "last 4 versions",
    "Firefox ESR",
    "not ie 11",
    "not dead"
  ],
```

!!! note
    Please notice that it does not target dead and deprecated browsers by its vendors.

### New webpack resolver plugin

A new webpack resolver plugin has been integrated with Volto, it reroutes
'local' resolve requests (for example `import Something from './Something'`) to
'absolute' resolve requests (like
`import Something from '@plone/myaddon/Something`). This allows the
shadow-based customization mechanisms to work consistently with addons and
Volto.

This is not a breaking change and it shouldn't affect any existing code, but by
its very nature, a resolver plugin has the potential to introduce unexpected
behavior. Just be aware of its existence and take it into consideration if you
notice anything strange.

### Content Types icons

Helper method `getIcon` from `Url` has been removed in favor of `getContentIcon`
from `Content` which is now configurable.

See [contentIcons docs](../configuration/settings-reference.md#contenticons).

## Upgrading to Volto 8.x.x

### Upgrade package.json testing configuration

The `dummy-addons-loader.js` file has been renamed to `jest-addons-loader.js`,
to be more in line with the rest of the existing files. You should add the
following value to the `moduleNameMapper` property of the `jest` key in your
project's package.json:

```
"load-volto-addons": "<rootDir>/node_modules/@plone/volto/jest-addons-loader.js",
```

## Upgrading to Volto 7.x.x

A misspelled file has been renamed. If you import `strickthrough.svg` in your
project, you'll now find that file at `@plone/volto/icons/strikethrough.svg`.

### New webpack resolve alias for Volto themes

As a "nice to have", a new resolve alias is provided that points to Volto's
theme folder. So, in your project's `theme.config` file, you can replace:

```less
@themesFolder: '../../node_modules/@plone/volto/theme/themes';
@siteFolder: "../../theme";
@fontPath : "../../@{theme}/assets/fonts";
```
with:

```less
@themesFolder: '~volto-themes';
@siteFolder: '~@package/../theme';
@fontPath: "~volto-themes/@{theme}/assets/fonts";
```

You might consider moving your theme files to a subfolder called `site`, to
prepare for the arrival of addons theming and their overrides.  In that case,
you would set your `@siteFolder` to:

```
@siteFolder: '~@package/../theme/site';
```

## Upgrading to Volto 6.x.x

First, update the `package.json` of your Volto project to Volto 6.x.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "6.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

!!! note
    This release includes a number of changes to the internal dependencies. If you have problems building your project, might be that you need to remove your `node_modules` and, ultimately, remove also your `yarn.lock` file. Then run again `yarn` for rebuilding dependencies.

### Upgrade to Node 12

We have now dependencies that requires `node >=10.19.0`. Although Node 10 has still LTS
"maintenance" treatment (see https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) the recommended path
is that you use from now on node 12 which is LTS since last October.

### New Razzle version and related development dependencies

The underlying Razzle package has been upgraded, and although that does not suppose any
change in Volto itself, a lot of development dependencies have been upgraded and they should be updated in your local projects as well. Might be that the builds continue working if you don't update them, but it's better for you to do so for a better development experience.

### Upgrade local dependencies versions

You need to update `devDependencies` in `package.json` in your local environment:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-prettier": "3.1.3",
    "prettier": "2.0.5",
    "stylelint-config-idiomatic-order": "8.1.0",
    "stylelint-config-prettier": "8.0.1",
    "stylelint-prettier": "1.1.2",
  }
```

and remove entirely the `resolutions` key:

```json
  "resolutions": {
    "@plone/volto/razzle/webpack-dev-server": "3.2.0"
  }
```

### Update `package.json` config

Add this key to the `jest.moduleNameMapper`:

```json
"jest":
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "@plone/volto/babel": "<rootDir>/node_modules/@plone/volto/babel",
    ...
  }
```

because new Jest is a bit more picky when importing externals. Attention, this mapping needs to be the first, it needs to come before the ``@plone/volto/(.*)$`` key.

### Prettier

Prettier has been updated, introducing some breaking formatting changes. It's recommended that you upgrade your local version of `prettier` and reformat your code with it using:

`yarn prettier:fix`

### Stylelint

`stylelint` has been upgraded too, and it introduces some changes in the declaration
of the styles order. It's recommended that you upgrade your local version of `prettier` and reformat your code with it using:

`yarn stylelint:fix`

### CSS modules are not supported anymore

Razzle does not support them anymore, so neither do we. If you need them, you could add
a Webpack config in your local `razzle.config.js`.

### Update your eslint config

Introduced in the Volto 5 series, it's recommended that you update your local ESLint config. In the past, we used `.eslintrc` file to do so. In order to support automatically Volto addons, you should remove it and use a JS based config one `.eslintrc.js` with this contents:

```js
const path = require('path');
const projectRootPath = path.resolve('.');
const packageJson = require(path.join(projectRootPath, 'package.json'));

// Extends ESlint configuration for adding the aliases to `src` directories in Volto addons
const addonsAliases = [];
if (packageJson.addons) {
  const addons = packageJson.addons;
  addons.forEach(addon => {
    const addonPath = `${addon}/src`;
    addonsAliases.push([addon, addonPath]);
  });
}

module.exports = {
  extends: './node_modules/@plone/volto/.eslintrc',
  settings: {
    'import/resolver': {
      alias: {
        map: [
          ['@plone/volto', '@plone/volto/src'],
          ...addonsAliases,
          ['@package', './src'],
        ],
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '.json'],
      },
      'babel-plugin-root-import': {
        rootPathSuffix: 'src',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### New wrappers in block editor

We have improved the overall UX of the block drag and drop feature by using the library
`react-beautiful-dnd` in the block editor. It introduces new wrappers (belonging to the
lib machinery) in the structure. The original structure and class names are still in
there (as children of these wrappers) to maintain maximum backwards compatibility. Those
might be cleaned up in next major versions, so if for some reason you have customized
the styling of your blocks in edit mode relying in the old structure, you might want to
review and adapt them.

### Update `config.js`

!!! note
    This is required since Volto version 6.1.0 [1541](https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/1541)

Add these to the `config.js` of your project:

```js
import {
  addonRoutes as defaultAddonRoutes,
  addonReducers as defaultAddonReducers,
} from '@plone/volto/config';

export const addonRoutes = [...defaultAddonRoutes];
export const addonReducers = { ...defaultAddonReducers };
```

Update the `routes.js` of your project:

```js
import { addonRoutes } from '~/config';

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: App, // Change this if you want a different component
    routes: [
      // Add your routes here
      ...(addonRoutes || []),
      ...defaultRoutes,
    ],
  },
];
```

## Upgrading to Volto 5.x.x

First, update the `package.json` of your Volto project to Volto 5.x.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "5.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

### New lazy loading boilerplate

Volto is now capable of splitting and lazy load components. This allows for better
performance and reduced bundle sizes, the client also has to parse and load less code,
improving the user experience, specially on mobile devices.

The boilerplate includes changes in the structural foundation of Volto itself. So if you
have updated in your projects any of these components:

- `src/helpers/Html/Html.jsx`
- `src/components/theme/App/App.jsx`
- `src/server.jsx`
- `src/client.jsx`

you should adapt them to the newests changes in Volto source code. You can do that by
diffing the new ones with yours.

### Testing lazy load components

The whole process has been designed to have a minimal impact in existing projects.
However, only a thing should be changed in your components tests. Specially if your components are composed of original Volto components (not SemanticUI ones, though).

You should adapt them by mocking the Volto component or resolve (await) for them in an
async construction before the test is fired. See this Codepen example:

https://codesandbox.io/s/loadable-async-tests-l2bx9

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";
import { Component1, Component2 } from "./components";

describe("CustomComponent", () => {
  it("rendered lazily", async () => {
    const { container, getByText } = render(<App />);

    await Component1;
    await Component2;

    expect(container.firstChild).toMatchSnapshot();
    expect(getByText("Component1"));
    expect(getByText("Component2"));
  });
```

This is also another pattern used in Volto core for testing, you can transform your test
in async aware like this:

### Helmet title now it's centralized in `View.jsx`

All the calls for update the title in the document performed by `Helmet` are now
centralized in the `View.jsx` components. It's recommended to remove all the Helmet
calls for updating the title from your components specially if you are using some of the
SEO addons for Volto, since not doing that could interfere with them.

## Upgrading to Volto 4.x.x

First, update your `package.json` to Volto 4.x.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "4.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

### New initial blocks per content type setting in Alpha 37

Not breaking change, but now there's a new setting in Blocks, `initialBlocks` where you can define a the initial blocks for all content types. You can override the default ('title' and a 'text' block) and provide your own by modifying the configuration object:

```js
const initialBlocks = {
    Document: ['leadimage', 'title', 'text', 'listing' ]
};
```

provide an empty object if you don't want to define any additional initial blocks and keep the default.

```js
const initialBlocks = {};
```

### ImageSidebar moved to Image Block directory in Alpha 29

For better resource grouping, the `ImageSidebar` component has been moved to the `Image` block component directory: `components/manage/Blocks/Image`

### Copy `yarn.lock` from volto-starter-kit in Alpha 17

Due to changes in the dependency tree, it's required to use an specific `yarn.lock` file by deleting it and copy the one here: https://github.com/plone/volto-starter-kit/blob/master/yarn.lock before upgrading to Volto alpha 17.

### Forked Helmet into Volto core

Due to the inactivity of the Helmet project, we decided to fork it to the core. It's part of the Volto helpers now. You have to update your imports accordingly. Please notice that now it's a named import:

### Alpha 16 is a brownbag release

There was a problem with the projects using Volto eslint config when upgrading to latest versions related to typescript, we will take of that in the near future. So skip this version.

### Stylelint and prettier config in Alpha 14

In your project's boilerplate, you need to update the stylelint and prettier configuration accordingly to the changes made in Alpha 14 in `package.json` like this:

### openObjectBrowser API change in Alpha 11

See the [blocks section](../blocks/editcomponent.md#openobjectbrowser-handler-api) for more details.

### Renaming Tiles into Blocks

An internal renaming to use the term `Blocks` everywhere was done to unify naming through the code a and the documentation.

Plone RESTAPI was updated to that purpose too, and running an upgrade step (do so in Plone's Addons control panel) is required in order to migrate the data. No step is required if you are using a brand new ZODB.

This is the versions compatibility table across all the packages involved:

Volto 4 - plone.restapi >= 5.0.0 - kitconcept.voltodemo >= 2.0

!!! note
    The renaming happened in Volto 4 alpha.10 and plone.restapi 5.0.0. Volto 4 alpha versions under that release use older versions of `plone.restapi` and `kitconcept.voltodemo`, however if you are using alpha releases it's recommended to upgrade to latest alpha or the final release of Volto 4.

The project configuration should also be updated, in your `src/config.js`:

```diff

### Add theme customization to your project

Volto 4 now also expects a file named `src/theme.js` with this content by default:

```js
import 'semantic-ui-less/semantic.less';
import '@plone/volto/../theme/themes/pastanaga/extras/extras.less';
```

### Remove enzyme configuration

Enzyme has been removed, in favor of `@testing-library/react`, and the configuration should be removed in `package.json`:

```

### Blocks engine - Blocks configuration object

The blocks engine was updated and there are some important breaking changes, in case that
you've developed custom blocks. The configuration object is now unified and expresses all
the properties to model a block. This is how a block in the `defaultBlocks` object looks
like:

```js
const defaultBlocks = {
  title: {
    id: 'title', // The name (id) of the block
    title: 'Title', // The display name of the block
    icon: titleSVG, // The icon used in the block chooser
    group: 'text', // The group (blocks can be grouped, displayed in the chooser)
    view: ViewTitleBlock, // The view mode component
    edit: EditTitleBlock, // The edit mode component
    restricted: false, // If the block is restricted, it won't show in in the chooser
    mostUsed: false, // A meta group `most used`, appearing at the top of the chooser
    blockHasOwnFocusManagement: false, // Set this to true if the block manages its own focus
    security: {
      addPermission: [], // Future proof (not implemented yet) add user permission role(s)
      view: [], // Future proof (not implemented yet) view user role(s)
    },
  },
  ...
```

There is an additional object `groupBlocksOrder` that contains an array with the order
that the blocks group should appear:

```js
const groupBlocksOrder = [
  { id: 'mostUsed', title: 'Most used' },
  { id: 'text', title: 'Text' },
  { id: 'media', title: 'Media' },
  { id: 'common', title: 'Common' },
];
```

You should adapt and merge the configuration of your own custom blocks to match the
`defaultBlocks` and `groupBlocksOrder` one. You can modify the order of the groups and
create your own as well.

### Blocks engine - Simplification of the edit blocks wrapper

The edit block wrapper boilerplate was quite big, and for bootstrap an edit block you had to copy it from an existing block. Now all this boilerplate has been transferred to the Blocks Engine, so bootstrapping the edit component of a block is easier and do not require any pre-existing code.

In order to upgrade your blocks you should simplify the outter `<div>` (took as example the Title block):

``` diff
--- a/src/components/manage/Blocks/Title/Edit.jsx
+++ b/src/components/manage/Blocks/Title/Edit.jsx

           }}
         />
-      </div>
+      </>
     );
   }
 }
```

The blocks engine now takes care for the keyboard navigation of the blocks, so you need to remove the outter `<div>` from your custom block, then your block doesn't have to react to the change on `this.props.selected` either, because it's also something that the blocks engine already does for you.

The focus management is also transferred to the engine, so no needed for your block to manage the focus. However, if your block does indeed require to manage its own focus, then you should mark it with the `blockHasOwnFocusManagement` property in the blocks configuration object:

``` js hl_lines="10"
    text: {
      id: 'text',
      title: 'Text',
      icon: textSVG,
      group: 'text',
      view: ViewTextBlock,
      edit: EditTextBlock,
      restricted: false,
      mostUsed: false,
      blockHasOwnFocusManagement: true,
      security: {
        addPermission: [],
        view: [],
      },
    },
```

### Default view renaming

The default view for content types `DocumentView.jsx` has been renamed to a more appropiate `DefaultView.jsx`. This view contains the code for rendering blocks in case the content type has been Blocks enabled. Enable Blocks on your content types by composing the view of your content type using `DefaultView` component.

### Deprecations

- The old messages container has been removed since it's not used anymore by Volto. We changed it to use `Toast` library.
- Improve the Pastanaga Editor block wrapper container layout, deprecating the hack `.ui.wrapper > *`.

## Upgrading to Volto 3.x

Volto was upgraded to use Razzle 3.0.0 which is not a breaking change itself,
but it forces to some changes in the boilerplate on your Volto projects. You
should change the babel config by deleting .babelrc file and creating a new
file `babel.config.js` with these contents:

```js
module.exports = require('@plone/volto/babel');
```

Then update your `package.json` to Volto 3.x.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@plone/volto": "3.0.0",
    ...
  }
```

Volto 3.x is compatible with the new changes introduced in the vocabularies
endpoint in plone.restapi 4.0.0. If you custom build a widget based in the
Volto ones, you should update them as well. Volto updated its own widget set to
support them:

- `components/manage/Widgets/ArrayWidget`
- `components/manage/Widgets/SelectWidget`
- `components/manage/Widgets/TokenWidget`

They all use `react-select` third party library for render it.

## Upgrading to Volto 2.x

### Improved Blocks HOC

The Blocks HOC (High Order Component) was changed to lift off some of the
features from the blocks themselves and now it takes care of them by its own.

- The delete block feature was moved to it
- The keylisteners for navigating through blocks was moved to it
- The properties passed down to the blocks are improved and documented

This change only applies to your existing blocks, you have to update them
accordingly by delete the trash icon and action from the end of your blocks

```jsx
{this.props.selected && (
  <Button
    icon
    basic
    onClick={() => this.props.onDeleteBlock(this.props.block)}
    className="block-delete-button"
  >
    <Icon name={trashSVG} size="18px" />
  </Button>
)}
```

Modify the parent element of your block making this changes:

```jsx
<div
  role="presentation"
  onClick={() => this.props.onSelectBlock(this.props.block)}
  className={cx('block hero', {
    selected: this.props.selected,
  })}
  tabIndex={0}
  onKeyDown={e =>
    this.props.handleKeyDown(
      e,
      this.props.index,
      this.props.block,
      this.node
    )
  }
  ref={node => {
    this.node = node;
  }}
>
```

- Add the keylisteners to the parent element of your block

```jsx
  onKeyDown={e =>
    this.props.handleKeyDown(
      e,
      this.props.index,
      this.props.block,
      this.node
    )
  }
```

- Add a ref to it and assign it to `this.node`.

```jsx
  ref={node => {
    this.node = node;
  }}
```

- Add a proper role for it

```jsx
  role="presentation"
```

Take a look into the implementation of the default Volto blocks to get a grasp
on all the edge cases related to keyboard navigation and how to deal with them.

### Reordering of the internal CSS, added an extra

The internal Volto CSS has been tidied up and reordered, for that reason, some
other extras have been introduced and the theme.config in your project needs to
be updated by making sure you have these two extras in the
`theme.config` file:

```less
/* Extras */
@main        : 'pastanaga';
@custom      : 'pastanaga';
```
