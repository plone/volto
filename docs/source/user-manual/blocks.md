# Edit content using blocks

Volto features the [Pastanaga UI](https://github.com/plone/pastanaga), allowing you to visually compose a page using blocks.
The blocks editor allows you to add, modify, reorder, and delete blocks given your requirements.
Blocks provide the user the ability to display content in a specific way, although they can also define behavior and have specific features.


(manage-blocks-label)=

## Manage blocks

In Volto, "blocks" are individual pieces of content that can be added to a page or other content area.
These blocks can be used to add different types of content—such as text, images, or multimedia—and can be arranged and customized to create a wide range of different layouts.

Blocks are a key feature of Volto, and are designed to make it easy for users to add and manage content on their website.
They are created using React components, which are modular pieces of code that can be easily reused and customized.


(create-a-block-label)=

### Create a block

To create or add an empty block after an existing block, click in the block, then hit the {kbd}`Enter` key.
A new empty block appears.

```{note}
There is a new experimental feature that places a `+` below a block when it is active or moused over, and when clicked inserts an empty block below the current block.

See https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/3815 for details of the feature and how to enable it.
