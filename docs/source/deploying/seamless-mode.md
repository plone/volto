# Seamless mode

## Feature history

This was added in Volto 13 as an experimental feature. During the experimental phase, we realized of several issues hard to solve, which made us rethink the feature into its second incarnation, available since Volto 14.

The first implementation wanted to unify both backend and frontend under the same sun, using the `Accept` header to route the requests to the API and the Volto {term}`SSR` server. As a reference and for the record, these were the major issues we encountered (https://github.com/plone/volto/issues/2706):

- Browsers are unable to differentiate cached responses using the `Accept` header, so the last one (usually the JSON one) was cached, then shown in some situations (like browser restart and open tabs). The back button also showed the JSON responses under some circumstances.
- The use of cache servers and services is hard since they do not accept the `Vary` header (Cloudflare) and in Varnish the handling is also difficult to differentiate both requests and cache (and then invalidate) them properly.
- Private images/files are hard to handle.

For all these reasons, we have reconsidered and adjusted the feature a bit to overcome all the issues found in the past.

```{note}
Seamless mode will no longer try to unify both frontend and backend servers, differentiating them using the `Accept` header. However, we are sticking to the name since it also depicts the intention of the feature: to ease the setup of Volto deployments.
```

## Challenges and goals

Seamless' mode main challenge is to achieve Zero configuration avoiding hardcoded `API_PATH` or other environment vars involved, and establishing good sensible defaults when setting up deployments (and also in development). So the Developer/DevOps doesn't have to overthink their setups.

These are the problems we wanted to solve:

- Avoid having to expose and publish the classic UI if you don't really need it
- If possible, avoid having to rewrite all API responses, since it returns paths that do not correspond to the original object handled and "seen" from Volto, so you have to adjust them (via a code helper) in a lot of call responses.
- Simplify Docker builds, making all the configuration via the runtime environment variables
- Content negotiation was an amazing idea, but the reality is that it was a promise never fulfilled, and it was sparsely supported in browsers or the web ecosystem.

## Features part of seamless mode

Seamless mode is a set of features in itself. Here is a brief introduction of them:

### Runtime environment variables

All the environment variables that are configurable now work at runtime, not at build time. This works since Volto 13.

````{note}
Before Volto 13, you'd do:

```bash
RAZZLE_API_PATH=https://plone.org yarn build && yarn start:prod
```

From Volto 13 onwards, you can now do:

```bash
yarn build && RAZZLE_API_PATH=https://plone.org yarn start:prod
```
````

This brings you a lot of power since you don't have to rebuild on every config change. You can also generate builds on your CI, then deploy them anywhere.

### Unified traversal ++api++

Since `plone.rest` 2.0.0a1, Plone provides a way to access the RESTAPI without using the `application/json` `Accept` header. It enables a new traversal handler `++api++` that returns RESTAPI calls seamlessly, without any additional path in its responses.

Seamless mode will use this convention when setting up development and production environments for you. So if no `RAZZLE_API_PATH` is present, all backend calls by default will assume a `++api++` is present in your backend and will try to use it.

### Use `Host` header to auto-configure the `API_PATH`

The Host header from the request is being read by the Volto server if no `RAZZLE_API_PATH` is present and used in Volto from the first request on. The information read in the SSR server is passed to the client app, so it also knows who the backend is.

## Advantages of the seamless mode

Delegating to the web server the responsibility of configuring how the components of the app should relate with each other, so you don't have to configure the same thing in several points of the architecture, making the whole setup less error-prone. Combined with the sensible defaults of using the default traversal route ``++api++`` and the runtime variables (or the absence of them), this makes deployments far easier and more predictable.

Theoretically, you could deploy several sites using the same Volto SSR server without
recompiling (just using the `Host` header in the reverse proxy). Before seamless mode, you would've had to have a Volto build for every site domain.

Opens the door for `http://servername/sitename` deployments as well, so several sites
hosted by the same Volto SSR server.

All internal links are app ones (thanks to the ``++api++`` traversal), so a link to a page /my-page will be returned by the API as is. So `flattenToAppURL` will still be required (for old deployments) but if seamless is adopted, it won't be required anymore in the mid-term.

The Plone classic UI is not public (which in some points clients might find ugly and
problematic from the SEO point of view), so indexers cannot reach it.

Repeatable docker builds (since the config will be based on runtime).

Ready to use production builds (e.g. vanilla Volto built, ready for testing), configured in runtime.

# Requisites for using Seamless mode

You need to upgrade `plone.rest` package to `2.0.0a1` version or later, and `plone.restapi` package to `8.12.1` version or later. So in your `buildout`, under the `[versions]` section:

```
[versions]

plone.rest = 2.0.0a1
plone.restapi = 8.12.1
```

or update your pip `requirements.txt` if you are using pip.

If you are using the official Docker Plone image, use the `VERSIONS` environment variable:

`VERSIONS="plone.restapi=8.12.1 plone.rest=2.0.0a1"`

## nginx example config for seamless mode deployments

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server host.docker.internal:8080;
}
upstream frontend {
    server host.docker.internal:3000;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name myservername.org;

  client_max_body_size 1G;

  access_log /dev/stdout;
  error_log /dev/stdout;

  # [seamless mode] Recomended as default configuration, using seamless mode new plone.rest traversal
  # yarn build && yarn start:prod
  location ~ /\+\+api\+\+($|/.*) {
      rewrite ^/\+\+api\+\+($|/.*) /VirtualHostBase/http/myservername.org/Plone/++api++/VirtualHostRoot/$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://backend;
  }

  # Legacy deployment example, using RAZZLE_LEGACY_TRAVERSE Volto won't append ++api++ automatically
  # Recommended only if you can't upgrade to latest `plone.restapi` and `plone.rest`
  # yarn build && RAZZLE_API_PATH=http://myservername.org/api RAZZLE_LEGACY_TRAVERSE=true yarn start:prod
  # location ~ /api($|/.*) {
  #     rewrite ^/api($|/.*) /VirtualHostBase/http/myservername.org/Plone/VirtualHostRoot/_vh_api$1 break;
  #    proxy_pass http://backend;
  # }

  location ~ / {
      location ~* \.(js|jsx|css|less|swf|eot|ttf|otf|woff|woff2)$ {
          add_header Cache-Control "public";
          expires +1y;
          proxy_pass http://frontend;
      }
      location ~* static.*\.(ico|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg)$ {
          add_header Cache-Control "public";
          expires +1y;
          proxy_pass http://frontend;
      }

      proxy_set_header        Host $host;
      proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      proxy_redirect http:// https://;
      proxy_pass http://frontend;
  }
}
```
