# Create a Volto project without a backend

```{versionadded} Volto 18.0.0-alpha.43
```

[Cookieplone](https://github.com/plone/cookieplone) is now the recommended way to develop Volto projects, using it as a boilerplate generator.
Even if you don't need the backend, you can create a Plone project, then use only the {file}`frontend` folder for your purposes.
As a bonus, it will contain the means for deploying your project.

```{seealso}
To create a full Plone project with both frontend and backend, see {doc}`plone:install/create-project` instead.

To contribute to Volto, see {doc}`../contributing/developing-core`.
```
