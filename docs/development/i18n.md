# Internationalization (i18n) in Volto

This document describes how internationalization (i18n) works in Volto and provides guidance for working with translatable strings.

## Translation structure

In Volto translations, each translatable message consists of the following parts:

- **Default** – the user-facing text (typically English)
- **Component(s)** – where the message is used
- **msgid** – a stable identifier for the message
- **msgstr** – the translated value

The `msgid` should be treated as a stable identifier and should not be changed casually, as it is used to look up translations. Typos and wording changes should be made in the `Default` value rather than in the `msgid`.

Volto’s extraction tooling always includes a `Default` value in generated translation files. At runtime, Volto falls back to the `Default` text rather than displaying the `msgid`.

## Message ID (msgid) conventions

While there is no strict requirement for how `msgid`s must be named, Volto generally follows existing Plone conventions by using identifier-style message IDs. This helps keep translations stable and avoids accidental changes when editing visible text.

### Recommended msgid patterns

Common patterns used in Volto include:

- `label_*` – form field labels
- `action_*` – buttons and user actions
- `nav_*` – navigation items
- `message_*` – system messages such as errors, warnings, or informational text
- `heading_*` – section titles or headings

These patterns are intended as guidelines, not strict rules. The primary goals are to keep `msgid`s stable, provide clearer context for translators, and reduce the risk of breaking translations unintentionally.
