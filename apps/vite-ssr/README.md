# Plone on Vite with SSR mode

This is a proof of concept of a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) build, using `@plone/client` and `@plone/components` libraries.
This is intended to serve as both a playground for the development of both packages and as a demo of Plone using Vite built with server side rendering (SSR).

It also uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) for its routing library.
