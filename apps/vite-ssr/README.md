# Plone on Vite with SSR mode

This is a proof of concept of a [Vite](https://https://vitejs.dev) build, using `@plone/client` and `@plone/components` library.
This is intended to serve as both a playground for the development of both packages and as demo of Plone using Vite build with Server Side Rendering (SSR).

It also uses TanStack Router as routing library.
