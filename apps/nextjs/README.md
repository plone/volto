# Plone on Next.js

This is a proof of concept of a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app, using the app router and the `@plone/client` and `@plone/components` library. This is intended to serve as both a playground for the development of both packages and as demo of Plone using Next.js.

## Development

To start, from the root of the monorepo:

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm --filter plone-nextjs run dev
```

Then start the Plone backend:

```shell
make start-backend-docker
```

## Deployment at Vercel


We introduce an environment variable `API_SERVER_URL`.
You need to create this environment variable in the Vercel deployment's control panel, specifying the URL where your backend API server is deployed, and the route where the API is located, as shown.

```shell
API_SERVER_URL=https://my-server-DNS-name.tld/api
```

### Application rewrite configuragtion

To avoid issues with CORS and maintain the server counterpart private, our Next.js app should have a rewrite, configured as follows:

```jsx
const nextConfig = {
  // Rewrite to the backend to avoid CORS
  async rewrites() {
    const apiServerURL =
      process.env.API_SERVER_URL ||
      'http://localhost:8080/Plone/%2B%2Bapi%2B%2B';

    return [
      {
        source: '/\\+\\+api\\+\\+/:slug*',
        destination:
          `${apiServerURL}/VirtualHostBase/https/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL}%3A443/Plone/%2B%2Bapi%2B%2B/VirtualHostRoot/:slug*`,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

Plone Client uses the `++api++` prefix as default, so we should create a redirect in our app pointing to the API server, but using Plone's traditional virtual host management configuration.

Next.js rewrites are picky on the `destination` field, because its rewrite library does not support URLs with regular expression operators.
Therefore, we can't use the usual `++api++` route for the rewrite.
This will allow us to infer the current server URL—even in deployed branches and pull requests—without touching the rewrite rules.
We will fallback to configure a `api` route in our reverse proxy of choice.

### Plone backend

You have to deploy the Plone backend elsewhere, since Vercel is serverless oriented.
We need to set up the rewrite rule in Next.js's `rewrite` feature as shown in the previous section.

We will fallback to configure an `api` route in our reverse proxy of choice.

For example, if we use `traefik`:

```yaml
        ## VHM rewrite /api/ (Plone Next.js)
        - "traefik.http.middlewares.mw-backend-vhm-api.replacepathregex.regex=^/api($$|/.*)"
        ## We remove the incoming /api and just use the path
        - "traefik.http.middlewares.mw-backend-vhm-api.replacepathregex.replacement=$$1"

        ## /api router
        - traefik.http.routers.rt-backend-api.rule=Host(`my_server_DNS_name`) && PathPrefix(`/api`)
        - traefik.http.routers.rt-backend-api.entrypoints=https
        - traefik.http.routers.rt-backend-api.tls=true
        - traefik.http.routers.rt-backend-api.service=svc-backend
        - traefik.http.routers.rt-backend-api.middlewares=gzip,mw-backend-vhm-api
```

## About this app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.
