# Plone on Vite

This is a proof of concept of a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) build, using `@plone/client` and `@plone/components` libraries.

This is intended to serve as both a playground for the development of both packages and as a demo of Plone using Vite.

It also uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) for its routing library.
