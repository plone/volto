# `@plone/blocks`

This package contains the default blocks provided by Plone.
This package is in alpha stages, experimental, under heavy development, and is subject to substantial changes in the future.
It's one of the Plone frontend strategic packages and part of the headless CMS story.

`@plone/blocks` is not part of Volto, and thus, is not used by it.
