Add autosave option.
It will save a copy of content of the block being edited in local storage.
If the editor cancels their edits or closes the browser window, then returns to the block, they will be presented with the option to restore or delete their autosaved content.
It also detects whether the autosaved content is older than the server content, and if so, presents the editor with the option to restore or delete their autosaved content.
Finally, saving the block will delete its local storage data.
