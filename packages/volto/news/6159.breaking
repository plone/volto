Fixed image widget position and look and feel in sidebar. @ichim-david

Breaking:
- Updated the markup of the widget in the sidebar to render the widget on a single column bellow the label.
- AddLink Pop-up of the widget is now rendered inside `toolbar-inner` instead of the document body, this fixes the positioning of the toolbar when scrolling.
