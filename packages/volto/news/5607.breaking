Added `ImageWidget` component with upload, drop, external, and inline capabilities. @sneridagh @ichim-david @dobri1408

Breaking:

The user experience of the image upload has changed.
The input field is now a row of buttons.
The input field's placeholder text was moved above the buttons.
Together these changes improve usability both on small screens and in small containers, such as when the widget is in grid block elements.
If you shadow the image block edit component, make sure it continues to work as you expect, or update it to use the new image upload widget component.
