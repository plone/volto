Added `ImageWidget` with upload, drop, external, and inline capabilities. @sneridagh @ichim-david @dobri1408

Breaking:

The user experience of the image upload has changed.
The image edit component has been splitted up and now it's using the new image upload widget.
If you shadowed this component, make sure it continues working as intended or update to the new image widget.
