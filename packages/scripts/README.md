# @plone/scripts package

This package is a library of scripts that are useful to automate certain tasks when developing Volto core or Volto projects.

## i18n

It scans and detects i18n messages from the code and adds them to the i18n machinery.

See https://6.docs.plone.org/volto/development/i18n.html for more information.

This script is installed in the `node_modules/.bin` directory and can be called via `yarn i18n` or directly in the `scripts` `package.json` part.
