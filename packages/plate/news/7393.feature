Upgrade to last version.
New LegacyLinkPlugin that supports the legacy link data structure used in slate block
Pluggable config system (initial, temptative one)
Rendering using PlateStatic means, so it uses Plate internals (which are pluggable)
Drop all things old slate
More "ordered" files layout
Reusable PlateEditor and PlateView from the outside, so you can taylor your own editor and renderer (eg. outside text block use case.) @sneridagh
