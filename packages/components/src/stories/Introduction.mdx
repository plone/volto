# `@plone/components`

This package contains ReactJS basic components for Plone 7 and Plone's frontend modular architecture.

The purpose of this package is to provide an agnostic set of baseline components to build Plone sites upon.

`@plone/components` is based on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html), the documentation there applies also to all the components in this package.

## Design decisions and assumptions

This package provides a set of simple, ready to use components with the following features:

- Agnostic (not tied to any known design system)
- Composable (they are ready to be the building blocks of other complex components)
- Theme-able (they can be themed, using both the provided basic theme as a baseline and custom CSS properties)
- Data-driven-less (they are dumb, presentational components)
- i18n-less (they do not provide i18n machinery or attached to any i18n framework or library)
- Built on a renowned headless CMS components library: [React Aria Components (RAC)](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html)

Since we are using RAC as the base, the styling of this package components are done via the [RAC styling options](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html).
See the `react-aria-components` section below for more information about RAC.
This package provides a simple and basic set of CSS rules to build upon.
Alternatively, you can bring your own styles, removing the basic styling or complementing it, and build on top of it.
You can even use RAC to use other CSS utility libraries, like TailwindCSS.

## Usage

You can use your choice of package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) to install the package in your app.
If you add the components to a Volto add-on or workspace, use pnpm, as shown.

```shell
pnpm add @plone/components
```

Whenever you want to use the components, all are exported as named exports:

```ts
import { TextField } from '@plone/components';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <TextField label="Username" />
    </>;
  )
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Styling

This package provides two type of components.
One using TailwindCSS and the other using pure CSS.
The TailwindCSS components are built using the TailwindCSS utility classes.
The pure CSS components are built using the CSS rules provided in the package.

## Tailwind

This package provides a set of components that use TailwindCSS utility classes.

[See this page](?path=/docs/tailwind-introduction--docs) for more information about the Tailwind components.

## Styling using pure CSS

This package provides a basic set of components that use pure CSS for styling.
These components are built using the CSS rules provided in this package.
You should add them to your project build to make the components properly styled.

You can bring your own styles, but the CSS you provide should replace what the basic stylying does and style the bare components from scratch.

You can use the CSS bundled for all components in a single file, or use the specific files for your components.
They are distributed along with the components code in the `dist` folder of the library.

```js
import '@plone/components/dist/basic.css';
```

or selectively:

```js
import '@plone/components/src/styles/basic/TextField.css';
```

## Theming

You can use the basic styles as a baseline while building the theme of your site.
You can take advantage of them, as they are very thin and basic (almost vanilla CSS for the components).
Using them as a baseline will allow you to quickly build your theme around them.
`@plone/components` basic styles provide a simple, yet powerful, set of tokenized custom CSS properties that will help you customize your own styles on the top of the basic styling.
You can override them in your classes while maintaining them for others.

### CSS layers

This package uses CSS layers to style the components in a more flexible way.
It uses the `plone-components` layer name to scope all the CSS declarations in the package.
The basic styling uses the nested `plone-components.base` named layer.
You can use the `plone-components` layer to override the basic styling, or use the `plone-components.base` layer to override the basic styling in a more specific way.

### Quanta

This package also features the Quanta components.
These components use the basic styling as a baseline, extending them to achieve the Quanta look and feel.
They also extend the basic React components in a composable way.
The Quanta styling is scoped in the `plone-components.quanta` named layer.

Quanta is built upon the basic styles in an additive way.
The use of the Quanta CSS implies using it upon basic styling.
You could take Quanta as example to build your own layer of styles over basic styling for your theme.

To use a theme built upon the basic styling, you need to import both the basic and the theme CSS, in this order:

```js
import '@plone/components/dist/basic.css';
import '@plone/components/dist/quanta.css';
```

You have the option of doing it selectively per component, too:

```js
import '@plone/components/src/styles/basic/TextField.css';
import '@plone/components/src/styles/quanta/TextField.css';
```
