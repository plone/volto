# Tailwind components

This package contains ReactJS components for Plone 7 and it's a core package of Plone's modular frontend packages story.

The purpose of this package is to provide an agnostic set of baseline components to build Plone sites upon.

## Usage

You can use your choice of package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) to install the package in your app.
If you add the components to Seven or Volto add-ons, use pnpm, as shown.

```shell
pnpm add @plone/components
```

Whenever you want to use the components, all are exported as named exports:

```ts
import { TextField } from '@plone/components/tailwind';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <TextField label="Username" />
    </>;
  )
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Styling

The Tailwind components are styled using the Tailwind CSS utility-first framework.
This means that the components are styled using utility classes, which are applied directly to the components.

### CSS layers

This package uses CSS layers to style the components to handle overrides and customizations in a more convenient way.
Tailwind 4 already leverages CSS layers to provide a way to customize the components.
This package extend the Tailwind defined layers:
```
@layer theme, base, components, plone-components, utilities, custom;
```

It introduces the `plone-components` layer to scope the components' styles included in this package.
It also provides a final `custom` layer to allow customizations and overrides.

### VSCODE configuration for Tailwind CSS

To enable Tailwind CSS IntelliSense in VSCode, you need to add the following configuration to your workspace settings:

```json
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["([\"'`][^\"'`]*.*?[\"'`])", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
  ],
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": "packages/components/src/styles/tailwind/base.css",
```

For Tailwind 4, you need to point the `configFile` to a Tailwind CSS file in your reference package.
In this case, we set it up to use the `base.css` file in the components package.
