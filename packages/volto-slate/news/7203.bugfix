This is a fix for "Cannot find a descendant at path [...]" error. In certain cases (e.g., after merging blocks via Backspace), 
editor.selection may temporarily point to a path that no longer exists. 
This causes Editor.nodes() to throw an exception. Wrapping it in try/catch prevents crashes and hides the inline toolbar gracefully. 
Reproducible scenario: text block with bullet list → new text block → write a word → go to first position of letters → Backspace → crash.
