# @plone/volto-slate

Implementation of the Volto text block using the
[Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/) JavaScript editor framework.

This is a Volto core add-on since the release of Volto 16.0.0, released along Volto in the same codebase.
For Volto 16.x.x and 17.x.x series, it is *not* required to be installed as an add-on.
From Volto 18.0.0 onwards (including alphas), this core add-on is released as stand-alone.
It is used in Volto as a released package and part of its `dependencies`.

See https://6.docs.plone.org/volto for more information about Volto and how to use it.
