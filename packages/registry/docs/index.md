# `@plone/registry`

`@plone/registry` provides support for building an add-on and configuration registry with infrastructure for JavaScript and TypeScript-based apps.

As a developer when you build an app, regardless of the framework and technologies used, it's a one-off app.
That means you have to build something that has very specific requirements, behavior, and look and feel.

Sometimes you need to build something generic that is pluggable and extensible.
In the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, this is often quite complex, and the existing frameworks do not provide the means to do this.
`@plone/registry` helps developers extend their apps in a pluggable way.
